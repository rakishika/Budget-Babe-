# Budget Babe
A budget tracker Google Chrome extension

## Inspiration
  As almost-broke college students, we saw a lack of financial and budgeting literacy for people in the gen-z community 
  and felt it was imperative to create a project addressing this issue! We have all used budgeting techniques such as 
  spreadsheets and notebook trackers but all are forgotten quickly. We believe that a budget tracker Google Chrome extension 
  is an easily accessible, and clean tool to allow students to track their expenses daily.

## What it does
  Budget Babe allows:
  - The user to set a budget which is displayed in the popup
  - Input the amount of money spent
  - Add a cost to their total spent amount directly from a webpage (think online shopping!)
  - Choose a category for spending

## How I built it
  I built this using Html, Css, Javascript, JSON, and jQuery.
